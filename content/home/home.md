Hi, I'm Naomi

I work to help make research more effective through greater openness, collaboration and inclusivity. My [CV](content/home/cv.md).
I am curious about the web and people (cultures, behaviour, connections). My [blog](content/blog).
I enjoy design (buildings, inventions, graphic), bouldering and running. My [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/_npscience/).
